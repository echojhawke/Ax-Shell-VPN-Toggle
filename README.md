# Ax-Shell-VPN-Toggle
This module adds a split-button VPN control to your Ax-Shell dashboard that matches the existing Network and Bluetooth button styling. It monitors and manages OpenVPN client connections configured in NetworkManager, allowing you to quickly toggle VPN connections or access detailed per-connection controls.
